# Gridmaster-lambda-chain

This repository contains a small wrapper build to self-host the ETM API and integrate it into the larger gridmaster chain. Functionally it starts the flask API locally in the containers, then proceeds to process SQS messages.

## Other Gridmaster tooling

The public results of the multi-model simulations are published with Tableau and can be accessed through the following link: [Access visualization tool](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gridmaster2022)
